        The current typescript/ts-node combination is not working. Out of the

        box runinng the tests fails with


        ```

        Error: Debug Failure. False expression: Non-string value passed to
        `ts.resolveTypeReferenceDirective`, likely by a wrapping package working
        with an outdated `resolveTypeReferenceDirectives` signature. This is
        probably not a problem in TS itself.

        ```


        Updating both packages resolves the issue.
