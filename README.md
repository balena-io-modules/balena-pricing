# Balena Pricing/Savings Calculators

This library provides a set of functions that can be used to calculate credit purchase costs
and savings when compared to dynamic billing. Credit pricing parameters can be passed in during
instantiation, useful for testing and experimentation, but pricing parameters used in production
are also defined within this package.
